Nurry and Lucy really like cooking. They cooked big delicious birthday cakes. They joyfully delivered songs.
Everyone cheered and laughed and clapped. Nurry wanted jack-in-the-boxes and Lucy wanted computers.
They quickly opened their gifts. The gifts contented them. They thanked their friends. They enjoyed the party.
Everyone slowly departed. Who would have thought that they could have had such a lovely gathering today?
