Nurry and Lucy really like cooking. They cooked a big, delicious birthday cake. They joyfully delivered a birthday song.
Everyone cheered and laughed and clapped. Nurry wanted a jack-in-the-box and Lucy wanted a computer.
They quickly opened their gifts. The gifts contented them. They thanked their friends. They enjoyed the party.
Everyone slowly departed. Who would have thought that they could have had such a lovely gathering today?
